      # Learn about Docker
      Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
      Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so
      you can deliver software quickly. Containers run anywhere!

      In this first challenge, you'll create a container image. Please wait while we
      boot a virtual machine for you.
  assignment: |
    Use this command to build a Docker image using the Dockerfile in
    this directory:

    ```
    docker build -t my-service .
    ```

    Did you notice the tab with the source code editor, next to
    the terminal?

      # Starting a container image
      Container images can be started any where a container runtime is installed.
  assignment: |-
    Now that you have built a container image, you can run it.

    ## Step 1
    Run the following command to start the container:
    ```
    docker run --name some-container -p 80:80 -d my-service
    ```

    ## Step 2
    Check the nginx tab (next the the terminal tab) to verify if the container is running.
    You should see a "Welcom to nginx" message

    ## Step 3
    To verify if the container is running using the command line, run this command:
    ```
    docker container ls
    ```
